# Replay Illustrations

## About

This repository contains illustrations that I regularly use in talks about [my work](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=GXvJB1kAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) on investigating fast sequential memory reactivation (replay) in humans using fMRI.

## Requirements

### Affinity Designer

To edit the `.afdesign` files you need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/de/designer/).
I currently use version 1.5.5.
Affinity Designer is not free but cheaper than Adobe Illustrator.
